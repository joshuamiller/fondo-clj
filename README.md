# fondo-clj

Fondo is a (nascent) specification for distributed, immutable, derived, addressable data. It defines a layer for addressing data, providing a foundation for downstream functions such as data caching, transport, discovery, and computation. (The word "fondo" is Esperanto for "foundation".)

This repository contains both a Fondo server node and client library
implemented in Clojure, but Fondo itself is language-agnostic.

For design rationale and implementation specification, please see the Wiki.

## Releases and Dependency Information

An initial release of Fondo will soon be published to Clojars.
